# Quick Message to Start Opus Conversation

## Copy-Paste This:
```
Hi Opus! I'm continuing TraceOS development from Sonnet.

**Current Status:**
TraceOS v2.0 backend is fully operational at ~/traceos/:
- ✅ TraceMemory (port 8000): memory, compression, 12 SVG modifiers
- ✅ Trace (port 8787): provenance tracking
- ✅ Orchestrator (port 8888): multi-agent coordination

All services containerized, networked, and healthy.

**What I Need:**
Build a React + WebGL GUI that:
1. Visualizes design variations on a 3D style DNA surface (WebGL/Three.js)
2. Coordinates multiple AI agents (Claude + local LLMs) with visible decision-making
3. Provides real-time design controls and comparisons
4. Shows complete provenance and lineage tracking

**The Challenge:**
The 3D WebGL style surface is the most complex part - needs to render 10-50 design variations as points, use color for style distance, height for quality, and run at 60fps with zoom/rotate/select interactions.

**I Have Documentation:**
Check ~/traceos/ for:
- SETUP.md: Complete backend details
- STARTUP_GUIDE.md: How to run services
- README.md: Project overview
- OPUS_HANDOFF.md: Detailed handoff from Sonnet

**Let's plan the GUI architecture!**

Where should we start?

## Alternative Shorter Version:
```
Hi Opus! Continuing TraceOS from Sonnet.

Backend done and running at ~/traceos/ (TraceMemory, Trace, Orchestrator - all healthy).

Need React + WebGL GUI: 3D style DNA surface for design variations, multi-agent coordination UI, real-time controls, provenance tracking.

Main challenge: WebGL/Three.js for the 3D surface.

Documentation in ~/traceos/. Let's architect this!
```

**Pick whichever style you prefer!** 🚀
